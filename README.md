Introduction
============
The CUL Rollover tool has been built to meet the specific requirements of City, University of London. Many of the options available in Moodles core back up and restore pages have been stripped out of our GUI and defaults used. For this reason, it may not be flexible enough to suit the neeeds of other institutions.

How Rollover Works
===================

Delete first
------------

The destination course is backed up.
All destination course content, blocks and settings are deleted. 
All source content and settings are copied over. 
Groups and groupings are copied over (if selected).
Any copied News Forums are deleted from the destination course.
Role assignments are copied over (if selected).
The destination course format is set to our default (CUL Collapsed Topics) and the default blocks are added. 
The number of sections is copied over.
The visibility of the destination course is set.
The start date of the destination course is set (if selected).
The TII assignments and assignments with TII enabled are deleted form the destination course. NB Other mods can be enabled to use TII eg Forum.
